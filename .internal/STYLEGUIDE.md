# Basecamp Mutual Aid Writing Style Guide

## Voice Overview

**Long-form description:**  
BMA’s writing style is *plainspoken, principled, and precise*. It balances trustworthiness with restraint, avoids jargon, and favors clarity over persuasion. Its tone respects the reader’s intelligence and emphasizes human relationships, care, and ethical boundaries.

**Short-form description (internal shorthand):**  
BMA writes like someone who’s serious about trust, doesn’t waste words, and means what they say.

## Writing Rules

1. **Use declarative, active voice**  
   Say what’s happening, who’s doing it, and why it matters. 

2. **Avoid gerunds and passive voice**  
   *Bad:* “Donations are being accepted...”  
   *Good:* “We accept donations...”

3. **Cut filler**  
   Avoid “just,” “really,” “very,” or “the point is”.

4. **Break long sentences into calm, readable lines**  
   Especially when listing services, policies, or steps. Respect breathing room.  
   *Example:*  
   > Donations can be made using major credit and debit cards, Apple Pay, Link, Cash App Pay, or Amazon Pay.  
   > All payments are processed by a trusted and familiar payment service provider.

5. **Use plain language**  
   *Bad:* “Utilize,” “engagement platform,” “leveraging solutions”  
   *Good:* “Use,” “site,” “work with”

7. **Maximize clarity with effeciency**  
   Especially for privacy, donation practices, or legal disclosures — clarity builds trust.

8. **Write as though someone might print it out and post it in a union hall**  
   If it feels solid in that setting, it’s probably right.
